00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,844
The Transformer, a novel neural network architecture

2
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:13,243
based solely on attention mechanisms, outperforms existing

3
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:16,732
models in machine translation and other tasks.

4
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:23,585
The researchers identified this challenge: Recurrent neural

5
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:27,509
networks used in sequence transduction models present

6
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:32,545
inherent limitations in parallelization and computational efficiency

7
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,840
due to their sequential nature.

8
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:39,828
Their approach was as follows: The Transformer

9
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:44,995
architecture dispenses with recurrence and convolutional operations,

10
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:49,402
introducing an encoder-decoder structure based entirely on

11
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:53,277
self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms.

12
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,948
The research yielded these results: The Transformer

13
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:04,113
achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks,

14
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:07,721
outperforming previous models by over 2 BLEU

15
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:11,902
on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,327
Looking ahead, The authors propose exploring customized attention

17
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:23,331
functions, combining the Transformer with other architectures, and

18
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,288
extending it to a wider range of tasks.
